## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- media queries

### What I learned

From this project i learned the use of media queries and improved myself on many aspects such as in using relative position and etc...

### Continued development

It was great designing this product preview card. I lerned a lot and realized that I still have a long way to go. I need to learn more about css grid and display properties.
